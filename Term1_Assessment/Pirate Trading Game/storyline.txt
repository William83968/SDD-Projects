The world now is now divided between England and Ireland
and your job is...ah...overloaded...
Hey, say no more and start trading!

May I please know your name?
(Click the bottom left of this box and type in your name...)
, shell we expel away the misfortune?
You saw the witch over there?
Go to that sacred widow and she'll tell you what to do
Witch: Oh, for god's sake finally...
Witch: Listen, your future is as bright as the light on the ship Queen Elizebeth
